# Dart Asynchronous Programming

![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-0175C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white)

This space focuses on understanding and implementing asynchronous features in Dart to handle operations such as I/O, network requests, and intensive computations without blocking the main execution thread.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a hands-on approach to learning asynchronous programming in Dart with async features, including futures, async and await, and streams.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understanding Asynchrony in Dart**: Learn the core concepts of asynchronous programming and how Dart handles asynchronous operations.
- **Working with Futures**: Learn the use of Futures to handle potential values and errors that will be available at some time in the future.
- **Async and Await**: Simplify working with asynchronous operations with Dart's `async` and `await` keywords.
- **Using Streams**: Understand how to work with Streams for handling sequences of asynchronous events.

## Resources

Here are some excellent resources to aid your learning:
